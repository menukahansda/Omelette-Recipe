## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I learned that list bullets and their content can be styled differently. I also learned that when applied to a parent element, the properties justify-content and align-items affect its child elements.

### Continued development

Vertical and horizontal alignment have always been confusing to me. Going forward, I plan to learn more about them by using them in my future projects.

### Useful resources

- [Google fonts](https://www.example.com) - This helped me find the desired fonts. It offers a wide range of font families that you can incorporate into your project by embedding their links or importing them.
